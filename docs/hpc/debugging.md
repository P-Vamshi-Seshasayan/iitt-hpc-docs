## Debugging
**Are you using the cluster for the First time?**
Please do not start immediately with a 16-node and 40-hour calculation
Start with a short 5-minute run on 1 core
Then try more cores on the same node
Then try going beyond one node
Then increase the system size and make your calculation longer

**If your job is failing, create a small example for you**
Something that runs in 5 minutes
Where you know the result and the timing
Run the small example

**Shorter example is easier to debug and does not queue "forever"**
