##Disk space allocation on Lotus cluster
To store the data special directories have been made available to the users with name "storage and home" the path to this directory is "/storage" and "/home". Whereas these directories are common to all the users, a user will get his own directory with their username in ```/storage/``` as well as ```/home/``` directories where they can store their data. Disk-space in ```/home``` may be used for installing any applications by a user if desired. However, all computations must be executed in ```/storage```.

    ```/home/`<username>`/```: This directory is generally used by the user to install applications.

!!! important
    ```/storage/`<username>`/```: This directory is used to store the user data related to the project/research.

However, there is limit to the storage provided to the users, the limits have been defined according to quota over these directories, all users will be allotted same quota by default. When a user wishes to transfer data from their local system (laptop/desktop) to HPC system, they can use various methods and tools.

**Disk-Space:** 
Total available disk-space in /home and /storage is 1.3 TB and 100 TB, respectively.

**Disk-space Allocation:** 
Currently, ```10 GB in /home``` & ```2 TB in /storage``` are allocated to each user.
