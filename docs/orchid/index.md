# Orchid cluster

## Introduction
The Computer center has recently set up a GPU cluster, Orchid, to support the ongoing research activities. These computing resources are available to all faculty and students. 

## System Configuration
The orchid cluster has one master node and 6 GPU nodes. The cluster has mixed nodes having 20/40/44 CPU cores, 128/512 GB memory, 3 x Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080Ti 11GB and 8 x NVIDIA TESLA P100 GPU 12GB GPUs.

The orchid cluster has a total of - 204 CPU cores, 1.5 TB RAM, and 15 x Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080Ti 11GB and 8 x NVIDIA TESLA P100 GPU 12GB GPUs. 

The orchid cluster uses the same job scheduler - PBS Pro. 

## Queue details

Currently, there are 2 queues - workq and p100.

| Queue Name | No. of nodes | No. of cores | No. of GPUs | Max. Queue Time |
|------------|:------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
|workq       |5             | 164          | 15          |  10 days        |
|p100        |1             | 40           | 8           |  5 days         |

If you need access to the cluster, please request it in CCSS.
